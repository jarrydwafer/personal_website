When I was hired as the Senior UX Designer at [Graphiq]('https://www.graphiq.com/'), the company was going through a hockey-stick like growth spike. My second week on the job, we saw over 1,000,000 unique visits in a single day - so we celebrated.

And then soon afterwards, it came. The Panda 4.0 search algorithm update by Google. Almost overnight, we lost half of our traffic and subsequently half of our revenue from Google's newly refined search algorithm. All of a sudden our company was in crisis mode, and we had to bounce back fast. We had to find ways to test every hypothesis that we could come up with and utilize any and all sound strategies that we could devise to attempt to turn the sails and start tacking to get back upwind.

### The Problem

Staring at our google analytics account, our team struggled to figure out what we were being penalized so heavily for. Google does not release information about any changes to their algorithms, so you have to make risky changes that may take weeks to see any effects. Questions kept rolled in and suggested improvements came at our team from every angle.

Did we not provide clear enough citations on all of our pages? Were our question and answer pages, used to rank on top of long-tail organic search queries, considered bad content? Was our site not optimized well enough for mobile?

It was clear to our team. Our surface level understanding of our users and our reliance on google analytics were no longer going to cut it. It was time for us to fight for a better user understanding and experience. It was time for me to become the voice of the user.

### Limitations

I don't intend to bore you with an epic saga of SEO ups and downs, but this moment of crisis raised some serious red flags for our User Experience team. Our first and foremost problem, was our reliance on Google for traffic. We desperately needed to diversify our traffic sources. And our second major issue was relying on Google for segmented user-data that really did not allow us to dive deep into understanding our user's behavior.

### Solution

So let's take it from there - understand our users.
