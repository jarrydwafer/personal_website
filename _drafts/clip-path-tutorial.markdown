### Background on SVG clip path.

SVG clip path is an interesting way to mask an image in the shape of a vector object on a website. There are many creative uses for clipping mask on the web, one of my favorites is to clip text with an animated gif.

### How to define SVG Clip Paths

To get started, you want to create a vector object that you will be using to create the max. In this case, I created two vector objects that I will be overlaying. One is the complex vector shape, and the other is one layer that we will be using to clip a gif animation.

Add your image to be clipped and give it a class to add the CSS clip-path property.
